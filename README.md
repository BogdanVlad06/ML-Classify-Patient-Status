# ML-Classify-Patient-Status

## Description
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify patient status (dead/alive) based on medical features.
https://judge.nitro-ai.org/roai-2025/simulare-ojia-2/problems/1/task

## Tools Used
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, etc.
- **Data**: Dataset containing patient health records

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
2. **Model Training**: Train different classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and tune hyperparameters.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BogdanVlad06/ML-Classify-Patient-Status.git
    ```
2. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the notebook and run the cells in sequence.

## Example Usage
You can follow the steps in the Jupyter notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate them.
